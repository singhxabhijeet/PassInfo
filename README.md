A lightweight Javascript web application that allows users to test the strength of a password, how long it may take to crack as well as check to see if it has been featured in a known data breach.

PassCheck doesn't log or store passwords that have been entered into it, the only place your password is transmitted to is to haveibeenpwned.com over a HTTPS connection. No information regarding you is logged against that password, so it is not possible to identify what user or IP address has checked a password on the site.
